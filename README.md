## Challenges
This is a very challenging dataset, for the sole reason that it is massive. It is also static, and is only current as of the date for which it was published.
If I could redo this project, I would set up API calls to Yahoo Finance in order to retrieve the most recent stock prices for this analysis. 
This project was limited to my very beginner knowledge of machine learning and self-taught time series analysis usage.
